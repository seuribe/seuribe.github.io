      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi,
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm Sebasti&aacute;n, a human from planet Earth!
      </p>
      <p>
        My career started in computer science, but I quickly realized that what I really cared about was building a more equal and sustainable world for all humanity.
        By combining systemic thinking and my experience in education, game design and facilitation, I create participative, playful workshops and activities to discuss complex issues.
      <p>
      </p>
        I strive to create safe spaces where people can speak, listen and reflect. Only then we can connect with each other, express our needs and desires, and find the support that we need to build a better future for everyone.
      </p>
