	What if you could easily discuss your innermost feelings with a close friends or family and feel like you're listened to, understood and cared for - even when you don't actually have friends or family? Today, we're excited to announce Faceliza, a new audio and chat service that dramatically changes the way we feel that we are connected with others. Thanks to AI technology, Faceliza makes talking about your problems easier and more like chatting with a friend who always understands you. When you don't have real people to talk about your problems with, Faceliza lets you feel like you have one.
	<h3>Why Faceliza</h3>
	In general, when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information - reading but not interacting with people - they report feeling worse afterward. In one experiment, University of Michigan students randomly assigned to read social feeds for 10 minutes were in a worse mood at the end of the day than students assigned to post or talk to friends on social networks. 
	On the other hand, actively interacting with people - especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions - is linked to improvements in well-being. This ability to connect with relatives, classmates, and colleagues is what drew many of us to social networks in the first place, and it's no surprise that staying in touch with these friends and loved ones brings us joy and strengthens our sense of community. We want the time people spend on social networks to encourage meaningful social interactions. 
	But sometimes we don't find the time to establish meaninful connections with those that we love. And for those of us who don't even have friends, we created Faceliza, our AI-powered chatbot. Faceliza is always there for you.
	<h3>Built with Privacy + Security in Mind</h3>
	We know that privacy and security are important when you bring new technology into your life. That's why we designed Faceliza with tools that give you control over what happens with your conversations. We don't listen to, view, or keep the contents of your Faceliza chats. Your conversations stay between you, Faceliza and third party advertisers. In addition, chats with Faceliza are encrypted, so your conversations are always secure.
