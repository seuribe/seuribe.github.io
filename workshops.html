      <h1>Workshops</h1>
      <p>
        Part of my work involves organizing and running workshops.
        <br>
        I've trained as a referent for Global Learning with <a class="black" href="https://www.bildung-trifft-entwicklung.de/">Bildung Trifft Entwicklung</a> and have led workshops using <a class="black" href="https://www.climateinteractive.org/en-roads/">EN-Roads</a> as an Ambassador from <a class="black" href="https://www.climateinteractive.org/">Climate Interactive</a>.
        In addition, I've also created and led workshops on Artificial Intelligence for schools with <a class="black" href="https://imaginary.org/">IMAGINARY</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy creating playful activities to make difficult topics engaging and easier to discuss.<br>
        Some of the topics I love to discuss are <b>Post- & Neocolonialism</b>, the <b>Climate Crisis</b>, <b>sustainable production and consumption</b>, and <b>techno-utopianism</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Selected workshops:</p>
      <details>
        <summary class="pa3"><span class="f4">What is the climate crisis, and what can we do about it?</span></summary>
        <p>Every day we hear about droughts, floods, extreme heat, famine and other extreme events caused by climate change.
        We are aware that there is a connection between them and our lives and work, but it is hard to understand what we can do about it.
        <br>
        In this workshop, we will:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Review the basics of climate science, and the earth as a complex system.</li>
          <li>Understand how our actions influence the earth systems, and the consequences of these actions around the world.</li>
          <li>Find out what we can do as individuals, professionals and organizations, to reduce our impact and prevent the most severe effects of the climate crisis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <u>Target audience</u>: everyone! No previous experiences or knowledge required.

        <summary class="pa3"><span class="f4">Climate Simulation Action Game with EN-Roads</span></summary>
        <p>
          En-ROADS is a global climate simulator that allows users to explore the impact that dozens of policies—such as electrifying transport, pricing carbon, and improving agricultural practices—have on hundreds of factors like energy prices, temperature, air quality, and sea level rise.
          Developed by Climate Interactive, the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, and Ventana Systems, En-ROADS is a system dynamics model carefully grounded in the best available science, and has been calibrated against a wide range of existing integrated assessment, climate, and energy models.
