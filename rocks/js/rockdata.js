    title: 'The White Rock Above us All',
    text: `A founding myth that still influences Rock society to this day, is that of the <i>White Rock above us all</i>.<br>
    Rocks place great emphasis on their vertical placement. A higher physical position is regarded also as high socially, and this seems to influence all of rocks’ activities and opinions. It is no surprise that the periodic sighting of what looks like a white, round rock floating above everything else, has exerted a strong influence on the perception of superiority in countless generations of rocks everywhere. What is surprising, though, is that rocks seem to have arbitrarily focused on the color of this rock, and not in other factors - like its shape, or the periodicity with which it appears - and used it to proclaim the superiority of white rocks above all others.<br>
    Even when there is no scientific evidence to support this claim of superiority, and when plenty of rocks these days disagree with this perceived superiority, its effects can still be seen everywhere in rock society.`,

    title: 'The UrRock and the diminishing power of age',
    text: `In the beginning was the rock. A gigantic rock, the size of the world. A rock containing all ideas and thoughts that there have even been and will ever be. Then, a meteorite hit broke it up, diving both mind and matter. These pieces eventually broke up too, and the more the rocks subdivided, the more their ideas were spread apart. This is the main foundational myth of rocks: the UrRock.<br>
    It’s possible to understand a lot about rocks from it. Young, big rocks contain many thoughts and ideas. They can communicate easily with others, as they will always find some similar thoughts that, even if not perfectly shared, are close enough to allow mutual understanding. As rocks age and reduce both their size and mind, they become focused on a very small set of things. Incapable of sharing ideas, understanding others, or being understood, they end up secluded. Becoming smaller and smaller, they dissolve not only physicaly but also socially, eventually reaching the point where they are never to be seen again.`,

    title: 'Time and the Perception of Change',
    text: `The inherent longevity of rocks gives them a very different perspective on time, than that of humans. But while it might be initially understood as simply a matter of scale, or in other words, that they perceive things for longer or slower, their perception is actually of a different kind altogether.<br>
    Rocks don’t change, unless affected by external factors. Does this immutability also apply to their perceptive capabilities? Can perception exist without mutation? Rocks do perceive change, they just have a hard time accepting it. In a way, they are incapacitated to incorporate this sensing. As this rock once famously said: <i>“Rocks can see, but not know”</i>.<br>
    For example, a rock might sense an increase in temperature through time, but if it believes that temperature does not change, then it will not change its mind. Or worse: it might even say that the change happens backwards, and that the temperature is actually declining! Even when faced with external evidence, it might deny it and become fixated in its view that this change is not happening, and it might be impossible to change its mind.`,

    title: 'Rock Art',
    text: `While it is clear that handling a musical instrument or a paintbrush would be a challenging task for a rock, there is no real reason for them to not engage in other forms of art, like singing, or oral storytelling. One could expect that such long-lived entities would be particularly apt at long prose, and epic poems should came natural to them. Yet, art is rare among rocks.<br>
    Their best known poem (anonymous):<br>
    <p class="i f3">
    I am a rock, solid rock.<br>
    There are other,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;rocks, too.<br>
    We are rocks, a rock<br>
    A rock, a rock rock rock.</p>`,

    title: 'Evolutionary efficiency',
    text: `Do rocks move? After several years spent among rocks, conducting numerous field experiments and measurements, I can say with a great degree of certainty: no.<br>
    Most rocks don’t even question it: as far as they know it has always been like that, and they couldn’t care less if it remained that way forever. While it’s true that they don’t engage in hunting or gathering activities, nor they need to escape from predators, it might still be useful for them to be able to change where they stand once in a while. Visit places. See different landscapes. Still, they don’t. But Why?<br>
    A rock over which I was lying on a sunny provided me with a clue to this mystery. The evolutionary process continuously improves the fitness of an organism to their environment, which mostly translates to being able to process energy efficiently. And who is more efficient than rocks? They can accumulate energy through heat or magnetism, and make very little use of it. And they have remained in their current form for as long as anyone knows, unaltered by the evolutionary process. Might rocks be the culmination of evolution?`,
